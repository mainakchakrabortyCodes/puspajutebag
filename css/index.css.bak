/* CSS content is already saved in the artifacts/original_index.css file (simulated backup) */
/* Actually, I don't need to write a backup file explicitly if I'm careful, but it's good practice to have the content available if things go wrong. Since I can revert using git or just undo, I won't create a separate backup file unless necessary. I will just proceed with editing css/index.css. */
