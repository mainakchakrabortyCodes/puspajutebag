                        Few years back, I used to bring fifteen or twenty pieces of plastic bag at home with my
                        groceries
                        in a week. But I knew it's not good for our environment though I brought them because it was a
                        past habit like other people. I have been conscious about the environment and nature from my
                        childhood and thought I had to do something to reduce the usage of plastic bags to protect our
                        environment otherwise within few years our beautiful world will brought to the brink of
                        destruction. I had no idea how I could do this because I am not a scientist or a noble man. One
                        day I had an idea and decided to make a business with Jute products with a mission to spread
                        Jute products which are both strong and biodegradable through the all corners of the world up to
                        the last breath of my life. I thought that was the best way to go through a good mission with a
                        business. I live in a place Kolkata which is famous for Jute throughout the globe although Jute
                        products are not cheaper than plastic products. I am now finding satisfaction from the fact that
                        day by day people are accepting more Jute products for its Eco-friendly nature.
